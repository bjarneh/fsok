small treeview / filter thing

## Bad but useful

I found a program on reddit that was terrible, but it was useful.
Everything was wrong with it:

* Global state
* Untestable
* Poor code quality
* Useful

So I wanted to copy the purpose and style, and just write something that
was fun and useful, sort of how I used to write small programs after just learning
how to code 20+ years ago. So here it is; a small treeview or flat view of files
that you can filter / search through with exact maches or via [fzf][1].

Files open in [vim][1] when you press Enter.
